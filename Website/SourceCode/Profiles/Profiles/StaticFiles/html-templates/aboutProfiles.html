        Part directory and part social networking tool, Profiles
        not only lets you search for faculty by name or keyword, but it also
        helps you explore and understand the different ways that faculty work together.
        This is done through interactive visualizations that reveal groups of
        faculty who research similar topics, coauthor scientific articles,
        work in the same organizations, or have offices that are physically close.
        Browse these visualizations to discover how you might already be
        connected to your next research collaborator!

            As you navigate through the website, you will see three types of pages:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="pb-3"><b>Profile Pages</b> -
                Each person has a Profile Page that includes his or her name, contact information, publications and
                more.
                Faculty can edit their own profiles, adding awards, a photo, and other types of content.
                Click the green <span class="inactiveExploreButton">Explore</span>
                buttons on a person's profile to view interactive visualizations of their networks.
            </li>
            <li class="pb-3"><b>Network Pages</b> -
                Network Pages show the many ways that faculty are connected to each other,
                such as by being coauthors or researching similar topics. Click the tabs on a Network Page to
                explore different interactive visualizations, such as timelines or maps of the network.
            </li>
            <li><b>Connection Pages</b> -
                Certain Network Pages will include a "Why?" link. These will take you to a Connection
                Page, which shows why two people that network are connected. For
                example, the Why link in a co-authorship network lists the publications that two
                people wrote together. The Connection Pages also reveal why certain people appear
                higher on search results and why particular concepts are highlighted on a person's
                profile.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">Visualizations</div>
    <div class="blurbForTopic">
        <span class="aboutProfiles-profilesTitle"></span> includes several different ways to view networks, including
        (from left to right) Concept Clouds, which highlight a person's areas of research;
        Map Views, which show where a person's co-authors are located;
        Publication Timelines, which graph the number of publications of different types by year;
        Radial Network Views, which illustrate clusters of connectivity among related people;
        and Concept Timelines, which depict how a person's research focus has changed over time.
        Access these visualizations by clicking the green
        <span class="inactiveExploreButton">Explore</span>
        buttons on profile pages.

    <div class="topic mt-2">Sharing Data</div>
    <div class="blurbForTopic">
        <span class="aboutProfiles-profilesTitle"></span> is a Semantic Web application, which means its content
        can be read and understood by other computer programs. This enables the data in
        profiles, such as addresses and publications, to be shared with other institutions
        and appear on other websites. If you select "Export This Page as RDF" from the "Use Our Data" menu
        when viewing a profile page, you can see what computer programs see when visiting a profile.
