	<div class="helpAboutTitle mb-3 mt-2">Help with Harvard Catalyst Profiles</div>

	<div class="topic">How do I contact you?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		Email us at <a href="mailto:contact@catalyst.harvard.edu">contact@catalyst.harvard.edu</a>.
	</div>

	<div class="topic">Who is listed in Harvard Catalyst Profiles?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		Harvard Catalyst Profiles includes all faculty from Harvard Medical School, Harvard
		School of Dental Medicine, and Harvard School of Public Health. Listings in Harvard
		Catalyst Profiles are automatic and based on maintaining an active faculty appointment;
		removal occurs only upon termination or retirement from the faculty appointment.
	</div>

	<div class="topic">Who can view Harvard Catalyst Profiles?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		This website is open to the general public. However, people with an HMS eCommons
		account or relevant HUID privileges can login for additional features, such as active
		networking, which is described above.
	</div>

	<div class="topic">How do I edit my profile?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		To edit your profile, click the Edit My Profile link on the sidebar. You might be
		prompted to login with your HMS eCommons or Harvard PIN account. The Edit Menu page
		lists all the types of content that can be included on your profile. They are grouped
		into categories and listed in the same order as they appear when viewing your profile.
		Click any content type to view/edit the items or change the privacy settings. Some
		types of content are imported automatically from other systems, and you cannot edit
		them through Profiles. They appear with a "locked" icon and contain more information
		when you click them.

	<div class="topic">What are the sources of data for this website?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		All data shown by default on this website are currently available on other public
		websites. Directory information was obtained from the University's PeopleSoft system,
		which feeds the HMS Whitepages and central Harvard Directory, and publications and
		keywords were copied from PubMed. If faculty had previously entered publications
		into FIRST, then a one-time copy of those publications were also added to this website.
		If faculty had previously entered awards and narratives into FIRST, then one-time
		copies of that information were also added to this website's database. However,
		this information is only displayed on the website if those faculty members have
		approved its inclusion. Default photos are from Harvard IDs, but faculty must also
		approve the use of those before they are shown on this website. Lists of co-authors
		and similar people are derived automatically from publications, and the department
		and neighbor lists are determined automatically from directory information.
	</div>

	<div class="topic">Why are there missing or incorrect publications in my profile?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		Publications are added both automatically from PubMed and manually by faculty themselves.
		Unfortunately, there is no easy way to match articles in PubMed to the profiles
		on this website. The algorithm used to find articles from PubMed attempts to minimize
		the number of publications incorrectly added to a profile; however, this method
		results in some missing publications. Faculty with common names or whose articles
		were written at other institutions are most likely to have incomplete publication
		lists. We encourage all faculty to login to the website and add any missing publications
		or remove incorrect ones. <a href="mailto:contact@catalyst.harvard.edu">Contact us</a> with
		additional questions regarding publications.
	</div>

	<div class="topic">How frequently are the data on this website updated?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		Directory information, such as names, titles, affiliations, and contact information
		is automatically updated nightly from changes made in the University's PeopleSoft
		system. Passive networks, such as keywords and similar people, are automatically
		updated nightly. Publication data that is automatically derived from PubMed is updated
		approximately every two weeks. Faculty can edit portions of their profiles at any
		time.
	</div>

	<div class="topic">Can I edit my concepts, co-authors, or list of similar people?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		These are derived automatically from the PubMed articles listed with your profile.
		You cannot edit these directly, but you can improve these lists by keeping your
		publications up to date. Please note that it takes up to 24 hours for the system
		to update your concepts, co-authors, and similar people after you have modified
		your publications. Concept rankings and similar people lists are based on algorithms
		that weigh multiple factors, such as how many publications you have in a subject
		area compared to the total number of faculty who have published in that area. Your
		feedback is essential to helping us refine these algorithms.
		Faculty can also login and add custom concepts to their profiles, but these
		are listed on the main part of the profile page, separate from the automatically derived terms.
	</div>

	<div class="topic">Who created Harvard Catalyst Profiles?</div>
	<div class="blurbForTopic">
		Harvard Catalyst Profiles was invented by <a id="griffinA">Griffin M Weber,MD, PhD</a>.
		The current and past members of the development team include Nick Benik, Nick Brown, Paul Gomez,
		Ken Huling, Shashank Jain, Melissa Kenny, Kevin Laitinen, Kellie Lucy, Krishna Nellutla,
		James B. Norman, Rob Piscitello, George Rakauskas, Jeff Rosen, Franco Valentino,
		Marlon Violette, Griffin Weber, and Steve Wimberg. This website would not have been
		possible without the amazing work done over many years by Susan Vomacka (HMS Whitepages)
		and Mortimer Litt, MD, (FIRST). We thank Joon Lee from the Center for Biomedical
		Informatics (CBMI) at Harvard Medical School for his expertise and advice on working
		with the Harvard bibliome.
